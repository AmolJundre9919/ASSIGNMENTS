    <p class="font1"> <h1>Conquests of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj </h1>
      With this motive, Shivaji Maharaj began to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts and his followers. In this process, he ruined a few of his very influential coreligionists. They had aligned themselves with the sultans. His daring military skills and sternness towards the Hindus' oppression had him win many battles and administrations. His depredations grew very audacious, and various minor expeditions sent to chastise him always proved to be ineffective.
      
       
      
      In 1659, when the Sultan of Bijapur sent an army of around 20 thousand soldiers under the leadership of Afzal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji Maharaj intelligently defeated Afzal Khan. He pretended to be intimidated and enticed the force deep into the difficult mountain terrains and then killed Afzal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by all submissive appeals. 
      
       
      
      For the time being, the handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it. Overnight, Shivaji Maharaj became a daunting warlord with the possession of horses, guns, as well as ammunition of the Bijapur army.
      
       
      
      Alarmed by the rising strength of Shivaji Maharaj, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. He encountered himself by carrying out a very daring and brave raid right within the encampment of the viceroy. In this raid, he lost his one hand and his son's fingers. 
      
       
      
      Embarrassed by this reverse, the viceroy withdrew his force. After this incident, Shivaji was thought to provoke the Mughals. He attacked the rich coastal town of Surat and took immense booty.  Aurangzeb, disappointed and raged by this incident, could hardly ignore the loss, and to avenge Shivaji Maharaj, he sent out his most prominent general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. Mirza Raja was sent along with 100 thousand men. 
      
       
      
      The pressure that was exerted by this vast force which was also combined with the drive and tenacity of Jai Singh, very soon compelled Shivaji Maharaj to call for peace. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj undertook that he and his son would attend the court of Aurangzeb at Agra to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds and thousands of miles from their homeland, Shivaji Maharaj and his son were both placed under house arrest. During the house arrest, they lived under the threat of execution.
      
       
      
      Fearlessly, Shivaji Maharaj feigned illness, and therefore as atonement, he began to send out enormous baskets filled with delicious sweets that were to be distributed among the poor. In the year 1666 of 17 August, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape was the most thrilling and daring episode filled with very high drama, which was about to change the course of Indian history. 
      
       
      
      His devoted followers welcomed him back as their great leader, and in the coming two years after this escape, he achieved many wars. He not only conquered and won back the lost territories but also expanded his domain. He collected tribute from the Mughal regions and also raided their rich cities. He also reorganized the army and instituted reforms for his subjects' welfare. 
      
       
      
      Taking lessons from all the English traders and Portuguese traders who had already gained toeholds in India, he began to build a naval force. He was the very first Indian ruler of his time to use sea power for trade and also for the defence of his region.
      
       
      
      Almost as though jabbed by Shivajiâ€™s meteoric rise in power, Aurangzeb intensified his genocide and persecution of Hindus. Aurangzeb also imposed a poll tax on them, connived at forcible conversions, and also demolished temples, and erected mosques in their places.
      
       
      
      Independent Sovereign (Purna Swaraj) 
      In 1674 during the summer, Shivaji Maharaj had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. The entire suppressed Hindu majority rallied to him as their great leader. He ruled his domain for almost six years through a cabinet of eight ministers. Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj who devout Hindu, who prided himself on the protector of his religion, broke the tradition by commanding that two of his relatives who had been forcibly converted to Islam should be taken back to Hinduism. 
      
       
      
      Even though both the Christians, as well as the Muslims often kept on imposing their creeds on the population by force, he respected the beliefs and protected the religious places of both communities. Along with Hindus, many Muslims were also in his service. After his coronation, his most remarkable campaign was in the south. During this campaign, he allied with the Sultans and blocked the grand design of the Mughals to spread their rule over the entire subcontinent.
      
       
      
      Spouses and Children of Shivaji Maharaj
      Shivaji Maharaj had several wives and two sons. His elder son, at one stage, defeated the Mughals and was brought back with the utmost difficulty.  Many are unaware of the fact that Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj has eight wives. His first wife was Saibai, also known as Nimbalkar. 
      
       
      
      The names of the other wives were Soyarabai, Mohite, Putalabai, Palkar, Sakvarbi Gaikwad, Sangunabai, and Kashibai Jadhav. His first wife, Saibai, bore him Sambhaji and three daughters. Soyarabai bore him a son named Rajaram and a daughter named Deepabai. His other children were Rajkunvarbai from his wife Sagunabai and Kamlabai from Sakvarbai. In 1659, his first wife, Saibai, passed away at a very young age due to a prolonged illness.
